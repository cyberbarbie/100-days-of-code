**Today's Progress**: Created 2 versions of a Koala Bear I coded in pure CSS. The first version is made with SCSS and Pug. The other is a VueJS animation.
I learned how to use SCSS & Pug preprocessors together, the basics of VueJS and a lot more about different CSS properties to create smooth animations and gradients.

**Thoughts:** SCSS was used to create variables for the shapes and colors which made the code reusable and easily structured. Pug is a template engine for Nodejs that compiles to HTML. What I found fascinating was that in the Pug document, you use proper indentation and nest classes.

In the second version, VueJS was used to dynamically control the state of the classes.
