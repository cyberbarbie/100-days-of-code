# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Main Objective/Learning Goals:
- To Create a CSS image every day for 30 days
- Learn how to create animations with JavaScript
- To strengthen knowledge of data structures & algos (creating a separate repo for notes)
- To Build a Full-Stack App with Node.js

### Day 0: January 6, 2021 (VueJS & Pug Pure CSS Art- Koala Bear)

**Today's Progress**: Created 2 versions of a Koala Bear I coded in pure CSS. The first version is made with SCSS and Pug. The other is a VueJS animation.
I learned how to use SCSS & Pug preprocessors together, the basics of VueJS and a lot more about different CSS properties to create smooth animations and gradients.

**Thoughts:** SCSS was used to create variables for the shapes and colors which made the code reusable and easily structured. Pug is a template engine for Nodejs that compiles to HTML. What I found fascinating was that in the Pug document, you use proper indentation and nest classes.

In the second version, VueJS was used to dynamically control the state of the classes.

### Day 1: January 7, 2021 (Panda Bear CSS Image)

**Today's Progress**: I made a panda bear out of CSS! 

**Thoughts:** 
I encountered an issue that I needed to fix and came up with a solution by breaking down the steps
The Issue: 
-- Sspecifically target one pupil to face left and the other to face right. 

Solution: 
1. I added an additional target called .pupil-right under the right eye so that I can create a css style that specifically targets that pupil

2. I used css transform: rotate() to rotate the pupils at certain angles ðŸ™‚

 I transformed the panda into an animation and added a shadow

**Thoughts:** 
####The main objective for the animation:
1. How to create the shadow- solution was to duplicate the nose (which is a circle with a border-radius of 50%), manipulate the width to make it wider and then use the opacity to make it more transparent, creating a faded effect.
2. How to make the shadow shrink - I created a keyframe animation where I utilized the CSS transform:scaleY() property to make the the shadow shrink at the 1.5s mark (end of animation).

I'm currently learning more about Sass :)

### Day 5: January 9, 2021 (Pure CSS Loading Animation)

**Today's Progress**: I made a CSS Loader that utilized a bezier curve function to create that flow of elements, animation-delay property to delay the bounce of each element and I targeted each element to show a different color.

### Day 6: January 10, 2021 (RE-BUILT & RE-LAUNCHED MY WEBSITE)

**Today's Progress**: This is such a big moment for me. Last December my website was hacked and with full transparent, a part of me died. All of the files were corrupted and it was intense malware. I really was dreading the idea of rebuilding from scratch but today I did it and it's live. Thank the universe, I had a backup of my blog posts on my computer so it's just a matter of manually re-uploading them. I made the site on WordPress. I was able to upload 3 of my blog posts today but I'm focusing the rest of the night on creating my next CSS Animations. I should have the rest of my blog posts (as well as a new tutorial) next week. 

On the site you can find a blog post detailing my non-traditional journey into tech as well as tutorials on Git, JavaScript and Python. I hope to put out more web development resources on there, definitely continuing my vanilla JavaScript series! My goal is to help people learn how to code in an accessible, relatable way...with the occasional anime gifs!

### Day 7: January 12, 2021 (Refreshed some JavaScript)

**Today's Progress**: I was on Codecademy refreshing my JS (I've been doing Python for the last few months!) and that's what I'll continue to be doing
