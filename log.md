# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 7, 2021 (VueJS & Pug Pure CSS Art- Koala Bear)

**Today's Progress**: Created 2 versions of a Koala Bear I coded in pure CSS. The first version is made with SCSS and Pug. The other is a VueJS animation.
I learned how to use SCSS & Pug preprocessors together, the basics of VueJS and a lot more about different CSS properties to create smooth animations and gradients.

**Thoughts:** SCSS was used to create variables for the shapes and colors which made the code reusable and easily structured. Pug is a template engine for Nodejs that compiles to HTML. What I found fascinating was that in the Pug document, you use proper indentation and nest classes.

In the second version, VueJS was used to dynamically control the state of the classes.

### Day 2: January 7, 2021 (Panda Bear CSS Image)

**Today's Progress**: I made a panda bear out of CSS! 

**Thoughts:** 
I encountered an issue that I needed to fix and came up with a solution by breaking down the steps
The Issue: 
-- Sspecifically target one pupil to face left and the other to face right. 

Solution: 
1. I added an additional target called .pupil-right under the right eye so that I can create a css style that specifically targets that pupil

2. I used css transform: rotate() to rotate the pupils at certain angles ðŸ™‚
